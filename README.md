# Lumina - Laravel Automation Project

Tired scratching the new project with laravel?
Try this template and make your work more efficient :)

## Includes
- Laravel 10
- Sanctum Authentication
- Metronic Theme (8.1)
- Gulp (SCSS, JS) Theme Tools

- Re-usable Back End Code (Controller, Model, etc)

## Theme (Metronic 8)
Theme folder on **theme**

Don't forget to compile node_modules on **theme** folder

  yarn
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

You could adjust style by editing scss & js files on those folders, and compile after that

  ```sh
  gulp
  ```

Destination folder in **public/templates/metronic/assets**, change dist on **gulpfile.js** on **theme**
(Notes: Alternatively you could just upload node_modules manually)
